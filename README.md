# 🎲 Smart Img2Img Composer

An extension for AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion WebUI. It randomly selects an image from a specified folder, automatically matches and assigns a prompt based on the image's filename, and seamlessly injects it into img2img.

## 🌟 Overview
Smart Img2Img Composer eliminates the hassle of manually changing prompts and base images when performing large batch img2img operations. By preparing a `memo file` (a prompt dictionary), the extension will automatically pick up the appropriate tags and send them to generating pipeline, making batch processing highly efficient and varied. 

## ✨ Features
- **Random image selection**: Randomly picks an image from your specified input folder for img2img.
- **Filename-based prompt matching**: Matches the filename (either exact or partial match based on threshold) to a prompt block in your memo file.
- **positive / negative prompt support**: Supports writing distinct positive and negative prompts in the memo file.
- **WD14 Tagger integration**: Built-in tab to auto-generate prompts from your reference images using WD14 Tagger, with smart category filtering.
- **conditional prompt injection system**: define custom dictionary rules to automatically inject stylistic tags when certain trigger words are found.
- **fallback prompt support**: Automatically falls back to a `[default]` section if the image name doesn't match any specific block.
- **automatic LoRA injection support**: Configure `lora:` blocks in your memo file, which automatically injects `<lora:name:weight>` only if the LoRA is actually installed.
- **config.json persistence**: UI properties including fallback options and custom dictionaries are saved to `config.json` and persist across browser reloads.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Copy the `smart-img2img-composer` folder into your `stable-diffusion-webui/extensions/` directory.
2. Restart the WebUI.

## 📝 Memo file format

Create a standard text file. It matches the image filename (without extension) to the bracketed `[section]`.

```text
[title1]
positive:
(masterpiece:1.1), 1girl, portrait

negative:
lowres, blurry, artifact

lora:
add_detail:0.8

[city]
positive:
skyline, sunset, cinematic lighting

[default]
positive:
1girl, simple background

# Comments starting with # or empty lines are ignored.
```

## 🔄 Fallback behavior
If the random image does not match any section title (either exactly or via partial threshold match), the extension will check if a `[default]` section exists.
- **Matched**: Applies the `[default]` prompts.
- **Not configured**: Does nothing (ignores).
*Note: This feature can be toggled via the `☑ fallback enabled` checkbox in the UI.*

## 💉 Automatic LoRA injection
You can define a `lora:` block inside any your memo sections. Provide the LoRA name and weight format `name:weight` on each line.
- The extension automatically checks if the LoRA exists in your `modules.lora.available_loras`.
- If installed, it prepends `<lora:name:weight>` to the positive prompt automatically.
- If not installed, it silently skips and outputs `LoRA not found: name` to the console without causing generation errors.
*Note: This feature can be toggled via the `☑ auto LoRA injection enabled` checkbox in the UI.*

## 🤖 WD14 integration & Conditional prompt injection
If you don't want to type memo files manually, use the **🏷️ Prompt Auto-Generation** tab!
- **WD14 Integration**: Upload an image, and it extracts tags (scenes, poses, composition, lighting, characters, and NSFW). Unwanted tags are filtered transparently based on category settings.
  * 🔞 **Advanced NSFW & Fetish Tag Extraction**: Contains a massive built-in dictionary that flawlessly captures highly specific sexual acts, bodily fluids, genital/mosaic states, and maniac fetishes that are usually lost during regular tag filtering.
- **Conditional Prompt Injection**: You can set dictionaries to automatically inject highly detailed stylistic tags into the generated memo text when specific trigger words are detected. Example:
  ```text
  night, city > cyberpunk cityscape, neon lights, cinematic lighting, rain reflections, highly detailed
  sunset, skyline > golden hour lighting, dramatic sky colors, atmospheric perspective
  1girl, smile > beautiful detailed eyes, soft lighting, expressive face, warm atmosphere
  outdoors, wind > flowing hair, dynamic pose, motion blur, cinematic composition
  street, night > urban photography style, moody shadows, film grain, realistic lighting
  ```
